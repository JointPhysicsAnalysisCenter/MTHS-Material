\begin{itemize}
\item Using what we have seen in the lectures, construct the character table for $C_{3v}$. To do so, start by listing all classes and numbers of symmetry operations. 
\item Then use the Schur's lemma to obtain which irreps are represented in the table and get their characters.
\end{itemize}
