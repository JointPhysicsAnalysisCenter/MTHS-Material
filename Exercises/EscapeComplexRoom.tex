\item Characterize the complex structure of functions $\sqrt{x}$ and $\log(-x)$ by finding the branch points,
branch cuts and number of complex (Riemann) sheets in the complex plane.
\item Repeat (a) for a function $f(x) = \sqrt{x} - \sqrt{x-1}$.
\item Construct a complex function with two branch points at +i and -i connected by a branch cut.
\item Locate zeros of the function $g(z) = \sqrt{z}+i+1$.
\item Find residue of the function $1/g(z)$ by computing a circular integral about the complex pole.
