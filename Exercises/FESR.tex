Consider $z$ a complex variable and $\alpha$ a real fixed parameter. What is the analytic structure of the function $z^\alpha$? What is the discontinuity across the cut?

Write a Cauchy contour $C$ surrounding the cut and closing it with a circle of radius $\Lambda$ in the complex $z$ plane, and check that 
\begin{align}
    \oint_{C} z^\alpha \mathrm d z & = 0
\end{align}

You can start with the simple case $\alpha = 1/2$, {\it i.e.} $\sqrt{z}$, then generalize to any real $\alpha$.
