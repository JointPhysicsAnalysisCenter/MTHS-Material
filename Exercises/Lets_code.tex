In this practical exercise we perform correlated fits to
MonteCarlo sampled two-point correctors,
calculated from Wilson lines for a $L=32$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Close the code repository
          \begin{verbatim}
    cd ~/Documents
    git clone https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/MTHS-code MTHS-code
    cd 07-22-Lattice
    \end{verbatim}

    \item Downloading the folder \texttt{Code/sheet\_7\_code} from within the school's github repo \href{https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/MTHS-code}{here}
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item \textbf{Install Python in a Conda Environment with Dependencies}

                    Make sure you have \texttt{conda} installed. Easiest way for homebrew users is ``brew install --cask anaconda''.
                    For linux, follow these instructions \href{https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html}{here}

                    Create a new conda environment and install the required packages:
                    \begin{verbatim}
    conda create --name lattice-qcd python=3.xxx
    conda activate lattice-qcd
    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib iminuit jupyterlab
    \end{verbatim}

              \item \textbf{Start Jupyter Lab and Open the Notebook}
              \item
                    Launch Jupyter Lab from the terminal:
                    \begin{verbatim}
    jupyter lab
    \end{verbatim}
                    In your web browser, navigate to the Jupyter Lab interface. Open the notebook file inside the folder you just downloaded.

              \item \textbf{Jupyter Notebook Cheat Sheet}

                    For basic commands and shortcuts in Jupyter Notebook, refer to the \href{https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html}{Jupyter Notebook Cheat Sheet}.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Once you do so, open the \texttt{.ipynb} inside. Note that the first two cells just load packages and fixed variables, described in the notebook.
    \item Now, follow the instructions in the notebook to try and obtain a good set of correlated Jackknife fits to the correlators provided in the folder.
\end{itemize}
