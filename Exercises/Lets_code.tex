In this practical exercise we perform correlated fits to
MonteCarlo sampled two-point correctors,
calculated from Wilson lines for a $L=32$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

\begin{itemize}
      \item Close the code repository, \href{https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/MTHS-Code}{https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/MTHS-Code}
      \item Navigate to the folder \texttt{07-22-Lattice/} from within the repo
      \item Install \texttt{conda}, all dependencies of the project following tips on \href{https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/MTHS-Code}{README.md}
      \item Launch Jupyter Lab from the terminal
      \item In your web browser, navigate to the Jupyter Lab interface to `07-22-Lattice/fit\_correlators.ipynb`
      \item Follow the instructions in the notebook to try and obtain a good set of correlated Jackknife fits to the correlators provided in the folder.
