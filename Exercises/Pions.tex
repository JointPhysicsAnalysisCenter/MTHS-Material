The one-pion states are of the form $|I,I_{3}\rangle$ with
\begin{equation}
    |1,+1\rangle=|\pi^{+}\rangle\,,\quad |1,0\rangle=|\pi^{0}\rangle\,,\quad |1,-1\rangle=|\pi^{-}\rangle\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{Item:Pi1}
          From the three pion flavors, construct the nine different two-pion states and their decomposition into isospin states.
    \item Invert the decomposition in \eqref{Item:Pi1} to get the decomposition of the isospin states into two pion states.
    \item Do pions obey Bose statistics? What is the angular momentum (even or odd) for the states with $I=0,1,2$?
\end{enumerate}
