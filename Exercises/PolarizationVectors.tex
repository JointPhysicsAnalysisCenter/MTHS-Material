Polarization vectors of a spin-one particle are given by
\begin{align}
    \epsilon^\mu_{\pm 1}(\theta) & = \left(0,\mp \frac{\cos \theta}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{\sin \theta}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\, \\
    \epsilon^\mu_{0}(\theta)     & = \left(\frac{p}{m}, \frac{E}{m}\sin\theta, 0, \frac{E}{m}\cos\theta \right)
\end{align}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
          Evaluate the amplitude for the decay of $a_1$ meson ($J^P=1^+$) to $\rho\pi$
          using the covariant expression, $\mathcal{M} = \epsilon_{a_1} \cdot \epsilon_\rho$
          in the following frames of reference:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \label{item:a1.rest.z} $a_1$ is at rest and the decay particles are aligned along the $z$-axis,
              \item $\rho$ is at rest and $a_1$ and $\pi$ are aligned along the $z$-axis, compare to \eqref{item:a1.rest.z}\,.
          \end{itemize}

          \begin{solution}
              The first one is $-(1,\gamma_{\rho},1)$, the second one is $-(1,\gamma_{a_1},1)$. Both equal since the two frames are connected by a boost with $\gamma = (m_{a_1}^2+m_\rho^2-m_{\pi}^2 ) / (2m_{a_1}m_{\rho})$.
          \end{solution}
    \item
          Compare three matrix elements in \eqref{item:a1.rest.z} configurations to the expectations from the helicity formalism,
          \begin{equation}
              A_{\lambda_{a_1}\lambda_{\rho}}^L = H_{\lambda_\rho,0}^L\,d_{\lambda_{a_1},\lambda_{\rho}}^1(\theta)\,,
          \end{equation}
          where the helicity coupling is parametrized in LS scheme reads,
          \begin{equation}
              H_{\lambda_\rho,0}^L = \left\langle L,0;1,\lambda_\rho|1,\lambda_\rho\right\rangle\,.
          \end{equation}
          Which partial waves are allowed in the decay, and what value of $L$ the covariant matrix $\mathcal{M}$ element correspond to?

          \begin{solution}
              The S-wave corresponds to $(1,1,1)$, while D-wave is $(1,-2,1)/\sqrt{10}$. Convariant formalism mixes partial waves.
          \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
