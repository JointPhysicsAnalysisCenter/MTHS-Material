\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Geometric series} \\
Prove the well known resummation of the geometric series:
%%
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:SW_0}
         1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots =  \frac{1}{1-x} \quad \text{for } |x| < 1
    \end{equation}
%%
can be analytically continued to $|x| \geq 1$ with the Sommerfeld-Watson Transform.

Assume that $|x| > 1$ and show that the summation can be written as an integral over the complex plane
%%
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:SW_1}
         \int \frac{d\ell}{2i} \frac{(-x)^\ell}{\sin \pi \ell} = 1 + x + x^2 + \dots ~.
    \end{equation}
%%
Draw the contour around which the above integration should be taken (careful with orientations and signs).
Deform the contour such that you can relate Eq.~\ref{eq:SW_1} to the series
%%
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^3} + \dots = \frac{1}{1- \frac{1}{x}}
    \end{equation}
%%
and arrive at Eq.~\ref{eq:SW_0}.

\item \textbf{Van Hove Reggeon} \\
Revisit the Regge behavior of Eq.~\ref{eq:vanhove} using the S-W transform. How does the inclusion of poles at $\alpha(s) = \ell$ change the contour of integration and the leading contribution to the asymptotic behavior?
