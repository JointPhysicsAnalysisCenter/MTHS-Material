A new \(\Lambda_b^{**}\) state has been discovered decaying into \(\Lambda_b^0 \pi^+ \pi^-\) with a prominent \(\Sigma_b^*\) resonance line on the Dalitz plot. The decay intensity distribution along the \(\Sigma_b^*\) band is provided in the supplementary material, which includes the helicity angle distribution. Your task is to determine the spin \(J\) of the \(\Lambda_b^{**}\) state.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down the decay matrix element for \(\Lambda_b^{**} \to \Lambda_b^0 \pi^+ \pi^-\) using helicity formalism.
    \item Identify the partial waves in the decay \(\Sigma_b^* \to \Lambda_b^0 \pi\).
    \item Determine the partial waves in the decay \(\Lambda_b^{**} \to \Sigma_b^* \pi\) for \(J^P = \frac{1}{2}^\pm, \frac{3}{2}^\pm, \frac{5}{2}^\pm\).
    \item Describe the unpolarized differential distribution.
\end{enumerate}

The unpolarized differential distribution is given by:
$$
    \frac{\diff I}{\diff \cos \theta} = \sum_{\lambda_0, \lambda_1}^{\{-1/2,1/2\}} \left| \langle L, 0; \frac{3}{2}, \lambda_0 | J, \lambda_0 \rangle d^{3/2}_{\lambda_0, \lambda_1}(\theta) \langle 1, 0; \frac{1}{2}, \lambda_1 | 3, \lambda_1 \rangle \right|^2
$$
