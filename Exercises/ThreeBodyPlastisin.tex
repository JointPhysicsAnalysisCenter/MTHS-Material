In a laboratory setup, particle vectors for a three-body decay are represented using metal wire sticking out from a plasticine ball.
The particles involved in the decay have masses of $1\,\text{GeV}$, $2\,\text{GeV}$, and $3\,\text{GeV}$ respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the center of mass energy.
    \item Compute the boost to the rest frame.
    \item Locate the kinematic point on the Dalitz plot.
    \item Use the plasticine and wire to show how the decay kinematics looks like in the system rest frame.
\end{enumerate}
