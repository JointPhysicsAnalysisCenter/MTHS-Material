A particle of spin 1 in the helicity basis lying in the $xz$ plane is described by the following polarization vectors:
\begin{align}
 \epsilon^\mu_{\pm 1}(\theta) &= \left(0,\mp \frac{\cos \theta}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}, \pm \frac{\sin \theta}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\
 \epsilon^\mu_{0}(\theta) &= \left(\frac{p}{m},\sin\theta \frac{E}{m}, 0, \cos\theta \frac{E}{m}\right)\\
 p^\mu(\theta) &= \left(E,\sin\theta p, 0, \cos\theta p\right)
\end{align}


Consider a particle with mass $m$ and momenum $p = m \hat z$ and with helicity $+1$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Boost the momentum and the polarization in the $x$ direction of a boost $\beta = 1/\sqrt{2}$.
\item Compare with the polarization vectors according to the new momentum. Decompose it in the basis of the new polarization vectors.
\end{enumerate}
